# EQUITY NOW, RISE TOGETHER #ENRT

"Equity Now, Rise Together" is a movement dedicated to fostering inclusivity, fairness, and unity in all aspects of society. 

We are at a crucial point. The weak efforts of the past keep injustice alive. We need to demand more--real change! Only together can we break down inequality. Let's stand strong: **Equity Now, Rise Together!**

A True commitment to DEI means creating an inclusive culture where everyones voice is valued ensuring fair practices in hiring , promotion, and pay. It also involves continous training, transparent progress reporting, genuine support for diverse comunities, and **dedicating ALL funds to prioritize DEI inititives fully.**

While some may worry this could cause issues, such as in orginizations historically focused on specific life threatening tasks, the reality is that adressing everyday injustices can significantly enhance overall efficiency and effectiveness. When DEI is truly prioritized, the benefits ripple throught the entire organization, improving outcomes in all areas.

This also means shifting away from valuse rooted in a "make number go up" mentality. Prioritizing DEI requires placing other values like customer obsession, operational excellence, long-term thinking, and passion for innovation second. When DEI inititives are fully embraced and funded, these values will naturally follow, creating a more just and effective organization.

Completely reinventing money by uprooting /[insert big bad banker entities here/] and transitioning to a decentralized, digital currency system would align with DEI values. This approach would enhance transparency, reduce economic disparities, enusre finacial inclusion for marginalized communities, and potentialy introduce universal basic income, fostering a more equitable and resilient finacial system.
